To be addressed in 7.21.5
=========================

271 - fix the IPv6-working probing to only exist at one place in the code and
      only get done once

272 - re-using connections bound to local port

274 - Ben Noordhuis' smtp + ssl patch

275 - Introduce a way to avoid sending USER for FTP connections

278 - "Configure  $as_echo does not work"

281 - Several scan-build warnings have sneaked in:
      http://curl.haxx.se/scans/

282 - 100 Continue responses should return the "final" HTTP response code: 
      "Getting the HTTP response code following a 100 Continue"

283 - bug 3208760 "Bad HTTP POST retry with READFUNCTION or READDATA set"
      http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3208760
      (suggested patch probably the right fix, add test case to make sure)

284 - bug 3172608 "No re-authentication when HTTP connecton is closed"
      http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3172608
      Would be nice if someone could verify the suggested patch

285 - bug 3163118 "Allow programatic use of telnet on Windows"
      http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3163118
      Would appreciate a Windows developer to give it a look before we apply
      the suggested patch

286 -
